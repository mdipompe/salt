These IDL scripts are meant to simplify preparing observations (Phase 1 and 2)
with SALT. They were primarily written with optical spectroscopy in mind,
but could be modified for a range of uses.

target_pipt_upload.pro is meant to take your target information
(positions, names, etc) and write a file formatted for bulk upload
into Phase 1 or 2 proposals. See the file header for more.

make_blocks.pro will take source information, finding chart paths/filenames,
position angles, etc. and build set of block files for batch upload in Phase 2.
It will start with the file block_template.xml, which you can tweak to have
a setup as close to what you want for most of your targets. See the file
header for more.

In the directory finding_charts, there are several Perl and IDL scripts for
making finding charts for RSS. These were primarly written with having an
interactive way to figure out ideal position angles for your targets in mind.
See the README within that directory for more.
