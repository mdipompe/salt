(Kevin Hainline wrote most of this, I just cleaned some things up.)

*Important* These scripts may not generate accurate position angles
far from the equatorial plane!

The main script is SALT_Finder_Chart.pl, which takes one argument that
is the name of a file with some information on the targets.

One main purpose of all of this is the interactive position angle
setting tool Kevin made. For each source, you'll see a field
cutout and can interact with it to choose an ideal position angle setting.

Note that there are two lines you may need to edit, depending on your
IDL installation (lines 97 and 391). These need to have the correct
full path to your IDL binary. If you know Perl better than me, you
could probably make this easier with an environment variable.

The IDL code make_chart_input will take your object names, ra, dec, the SALT
program number, and PI name, and spit out a file suitable for passing to
SALT_Finder_Chart.pl.

You can run it using:
perl SALT_Finder_Chart.pl target_info_file.txt
